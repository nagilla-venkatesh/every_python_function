What does excatly `sorting` means is, putting a collection of items into a well-defined order. For example, alphabetical, numerical, etc.

If we have number of students in a class who are identified by their IDs (1, 2, 3 etc) and we have student record files which are placed in a rack. Whenever required we need to pick the required student record from the set of records, once the work is over we need to put them back. If we have less number of files it is easier to check files one by one to get the required one. What about we have a large number of  student files ? This is where we need to arrange the files in a manner such that we can pick the student record easily. So we can keep the files in sorted order by student id and whenever we need a particular student file randomly we look at the student id on file and accordingly we search further. 

Similarly, we can find lot of examples in our real life as listed below:

* Arranging students in order of their heights. 
* In Amazon we tend to sort items by price from lowest to highest.

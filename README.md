# 1. abs()
An absolute value is the distance between a number and 0 on the number line, meaning that it is the positive number of any interger, float, or complex number. 

some unique attributes of absolute numbers are:

    . They are always non-negative (meaning, they are 0 or positive)
    . The absolute value of a negative number is equal to the absolute value of its positive equivalent.

# Advanced Python Functions 

# 1. abs()
An absolute value is the distance between a number and 0 on the number line, meaning that it is the positive number of any interger, float, or complex number. 

some unique attributes of absolute numbers are:

    . They are always non-negative (meaning, they are 0 or positive)
    . The absolute value of a negative number is equal to the absolute value of its positive equivalent. 


# 2. aiter()
In Python 3.10, the aiter() function was added. This function takes an asynchronous iterator and returns a synchronized iterable for use with that iterator.

# 3. all()
Returns True if each item in an iterable object is true and there are no false elements.

# 4. anext()
Return the next item in the asynchronous iterator that was given to you, or the default if the iterator does not contain any items.

# 5. any()
Returns If even one of the items in an iterable object is true, then true is returned.

# 6. bin()
Provides a number in its binary representation and returns it.

# 7. bool()
This function returns either the true or false value of the object. Only Integer value 0 is represented as False remaining all are True.

# 8. callable()
Returns If the object that was supplied can be called, then this value is True; otherwise, it will return False.

# 9. chr()
This function takes a Unicode code as an argument and returns a character that corresponds to that code.

# 10. classmethod()
Performs the transformation of a method into a class method.

# 11. complex()
Provides a number with a complex value as its return value.

# 12. delattr()
Deletes the method or property specified from the object specified if it was specified.

# 13. dict()
This function returns a dictionary (Array)

# 14. dir()
This function will return a list of all the properties and methods that are associated with the object.

# 15. divmod()
When argument1 is divided by argument2, this function returns both the quotient and the remainder.

# 16. enumerate()
This function takes a collection and returns an enumerated object from the collection, similar to a tuple.

# 17. eval()
Performs an evaluation and then executes an expression.

# 18. exec()
It executes the code that you specified (or object)

# 19. filter()
To remove items from an iterable object, use a filter function.

# 20. float()
Return a Python floating point number built from the given number.

# 21. format()
A value that you specify is given a format.

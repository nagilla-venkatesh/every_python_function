# Advanced Python Functions 

# 1. abs()
An absolute value is the distance between a number and 0 on the number line, meaning that it is the positive number of any interger, float, or complex number. 

some unique attributes of absolute numbers are:

    . They are always non-negative (meaning, they are 0 or positive)
    . The absolute value of a negative number is equal to the absolute value of its positive equivalent. 


# 2. aiter()
In Python 3.10, the aiter() function was added. This function takes an asynchronous iterator and returns a synchronized iterable for use with that iterator.

# 3. all()
Returns True if each item in an iterable object is true and there are no false elements.

# 4. anext()
Return the next item in the asynchronous iterator that was given to you, or the default if the iterator does not contain any items.

# 5. any()
Returns If even one of the items in an iterable object is true, then true is returned.
